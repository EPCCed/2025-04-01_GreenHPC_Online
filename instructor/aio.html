<p>Green software use is an emerging discipline at the intersection of
climate science, software design, electricity markets, hardware, and
data center design.</p>
<p>Green software use is carbon-efficient software use, meaning it emits
the least carbon possible. Only three activities reduce the carbon
emissions of software; energy efficiency, carbon awareness, and hardware
efficiency. This workshop will explain all of these concepts, how to
apply them to use cases on high-performance computing (HPC) systems and
how to measure them, as well as some of the international guidelines and
organisations that guide and monitor this space.</p>

<p><a href="https://climate.nasa.gov/global-warming-vs-climate-change/" class="external-link">Global
warming</a> is the long-term heating of Earth’s climate system observed
since the pre-industrial period (between 1850 and 1900) due to human
activities, primarily fossil fuel burning. <a href="https://climate.nasa.gov/global-warming-vs-climate-change/" class="external-link">Climate
change</a> is long-term shifts in temperatures and weather patterns.
These shifts may be natural, but since the 1800s, human activities have

<h3 id="climate-vs-weather">Climate vs weather<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#climate-vs-weather"></a>
</h3>
<p>Weather refers to the conditions of the atmosphere in a short period
of time. Climate refers to the conditions of the atmosphere over long
periods of time. Any changes to the long-term condition of the
atmosphere will also cause changes to the short-term conditions. An
obvious comparison is that if the average temperature of the atmosphere
increases, the average temperature of the weather in any given season
will also increase. Some examples of measurable changes to weather
conditions due to climate change are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Changes to the water cycle, including rainfall</li>
<li>Melting of ice</li>
<li>Heating of the land, air, and ocean</li>
<li>Changes in ocean currents, acidity, and salinity</li>
</ul>
<p>These changes can lead to flooding - both in coastal areas and due to
increased rainfall - drought, wildfires and more frequent extreme
weather conditions.</p>

<h3 id="greenhouse-gases-and-the-greenhouse-effect">Greenhouse gases and the greenhouse effect<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#greenhouse-gases-and-the-greenhouse-effect"></a>
</h3>
<p>Greenhouse gases are a group of gases that trap heat from solar
radiation in the Earth’s atmosphere. These gases act as a blanket,
increasing the temperature on the surface of the Earth. This is a
natural phenomenon which has been accelerated due to man-made carbon
emissions. Now the global climate is changing at a faster rate than that
at which animals and plants can adapt.</p>
<p>Greenhouse gases and the greenhouse effect are crucial to all life on
Earth and often come from natural sources like animals, volcanoes, and
other geological activity. The greenhouse effect allows the Earth to
maintain a higher temperature than it would without them by capturing
more heat from solar radiation. Like many other natural processes of the
Earth, the greenhouse effect is a finely tuned balance that can be upset
by multiple factors.</p>

<h3 id="carbon-and-co2eq">Carbon and CO2eq<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#carbon-and-co2eq"></a>
</h3>
<p>Carbon is often used as a broad term to refer to the impact of all
types of emissions and activities on global warming. CO2eq/CO2-eq/ CO2e,
which stands for carbon equivalence, is a measurement term used to
measure this impact. For example, 1 ton of methane has the same warming
effect as about <a href="https://energy.ec.europa.eu/topics/oil-gas-and-coal/methane-emissions_en" class="external-link">84
tons of CO2 over 20 years</a>, so we normalize it to 84 tons CO2eq. We
may shorten even further to just carbon, which is a term often used to
refer to all GHGs.</p>

<p>Energy is the ability to do work. There are many different forms of
energy, such as heat, electrical and chemical, and one type of energy
can be converted to another. For example, we convert chemical energy
from coal to electrical energy. In other words, electricity is secondary
energy converted from another energy type. In this way, we can think of
energy as a measure of the electricity used.</p>
<p>All software, from the applications running on mobile phones to the
training of Machine Learning models running in data centers, consumes
electricity. One of the best ways to reduce electricity consumption and
the subsequent carbon emissions made by software is to make applications
more energy efficient. However, that’s not where our responsibility
ends.</p>
<p>Green software practitioners take responsibility for the energy
consumed by their products and design them to consume as little as
possible. We should make sure that, at every step in the process, there
is as little waste as possible and that most of the energy goes to the
next step.</p>
<p>The final step in this chain is represented by the end user of your
product, not the finished product itself. This means our goal is not
simply to make the most energy efficient code or the “greenest”
software, but to think about the end user and how to make sure they are
not creating unnecessary emissions.</p>
<p>This might mean batching jobs together to take advantage of energy
proportionality or changing how a user uses your software. Let’s take a
look at some of these concepts and some ways that you can become more
energy efficient at every stage of the chain, right up to the final
consumer.</p>

<p>Most electricity is produced through burning fossil fuels, <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/world-electricity-by-source" class="external-link">usually
coal</a>. Fossil fuels are made from decomposing plants and animals.
These fuels are found in the Earth’s crust and contain carbon and
hydrogen, which can be burned for energy. Coal, oil, and natural gas are
examples of fossil fuels.</p>

</figure><p>Most people think electricity is clean. Our hands don’t get dirty
when we plug something into a wall, and our laptops don’t need exhaust
pipes. However, since most electricity comes from burning fossil fuels
and energy supply is the <a href="https://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/daviz/change-of-co2-eq-emissions-2#tab-chart_4" class="external-link">single
most significant</a> cause of carbon emissions, we can draw a direct
line from electricity to carbon emissions. In these terms, electricity
can be considered a proxy for carbon.</p>
<p>If our goal is to be carbon efficient, then it means our goal is also
to be energy efficient since energy is a proxy for carbon. This means
using the least amount of energy possible per unit of work.</p>

<p>Clean energy comes from renewable, zero-emission sources that do not

<li>
<strong>Clean energy</strong> - doesn’t produce carbon emissions

<p>Now that we know how energy is produced and the associated cost in
terms of emissions, based on whether low- or high-carbon energy sources
are used, let’s take a look at some of the ways green software
practitioners can improve energy efficiency. Understanding power usage
effectiveness and energy proportionality means you can make better
decisions in terms of how to use energy in the most efficient way
possible and waste less.</p>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="power-usage-effectiveness">Power usage effectiveness<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#power-usage-effectiveness"></a>

<p>The data center industry uses the <a href="https://datacenters.lbl.gov/sites/default/files/WP49-PUE%20A%20Comprehensive%20Examination%20of%20the%20Metric_v6.pdf" class="external-link">power
usage effectiveness</a> (PUE) metric, developed by Green Grid in 2006,
to <strong>measure data center energy efficiency</strong>. Specifically,
this relates to how much energy the computing equipment uses as compared
to cooling and other overheads supporting the equipment. When a data
center’s PUE is close to 1.0, computing is using nearly all energy. When
the PUE is 2.0, this means an additional watt of IT power is required to
cool and distribute power to the IT equipment for every watt of IT power
it uses.</p>
<p>Another way to think of PUE is as a multiplier to your application’s
energy consumption. So, for example, if your application consumed 10 kWh
and the PUE of the data center where it is running is 1.5, then the
actual consumption from the grid is 15 kWh: 5kWh goes towards the
operational overhead of the data center, and 10 kWh goes to the servers
that are running your application.</p>

<h3 id="energy-proportionality">Energy proportionality<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#energy-proportionality"></a>
</h3>
<p><a href="https://research.google/pubs/pub33387/" class="external-link">Energy
proportionality</a>, first proposed in 2007 by engineers at Google,
measures <strong>the relationship between power consumed by a computer
and the rate at which useful work is done</strong> (its
utilization).</p>
<p>Utilization measures how much of a computer’s resources are used,
usually given as a percentage. A fully utilized computer running at its
maximum capacity has a high percentage, while an idle computer with no
utilization has a lower percentage.</p>
<p>The relationship between power and utilization is not proportional.
Mathematically speaking, proportionality between two variables means
their ratios are equivalent. For example, at 0% utilization, a computer
can draw 100W; at 50%, it draws 180W; and at 100%, it draws 200W. The
relationship between power consumption and utilization is not linear and
does not cross the origin.</p>
<figure><img src=".././fig/06_energy_proportionality_updated.png" title="image_tooltip" alt="alt_text" class="figure mx-auto d-block"><div class="figcaption">alt_text</div>
</figure><p>Because of this, the more we utilize a computer, the more efficient
it becomes at converting electricity to practical computing operations.
One way to improve hardware efficiency is to run the workload on as few
servers as possible, with the servers running at the highest utilization
rate, maximizing energy efficiency.</p>
<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="static-power-draw">Static power draw<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#static-power-draw"></a>
</h4>
<p>The static power draw of a computer is <strong>how much electricity
is drawn when in an idle state</strong>. The static power draw varies by
configuration and hardware components, but all parts have some static
power draw. This is one of the reasons that PCs, laptops, and end-user
devices have power-saving modes. If the device is idle, it will
eventually trigger a hibernation mode and put the disk and screen to
sleep or even change the CPU’s frequency. These power-saving modes save
on electricity, but they have other trade-offs, such as a slower restart
when the device wakes up.</p>
<p>Servers are usually not configured for aggressive or even minimal
power saving. Many use cases running on servers demand total capacity as
quickly as possible because the server needs to respond to rapidly
changing demands, which leads to many servers in idle modes during
low-demand periods. An idle server has a carbon cost from both the
embedded carbon as well as its inefficient utilization.</p>

<ul>
<li>Electricity is a proxy for carbon, so building an application that
is energy efficient is equivalent to building an application that is
carbon efficient.</li>
<li>Green software takes responsibility for its electricity consumption
and is designed to consume as little as possible.</li>
<li>Quantifying the energy consumption of an application is a step in
the right direction to start thinking about how an application can

energy consumption is not the only story. The hardware your software is

<p>Not all electricity is produced in the same way. In different
locations and times, electricity is generated using a variety of sources
with varying carbon emissions. Some sources, such as wind, solar, or
hydroelectric, are clean, renewable sources that emit little carbon. On
the other hand, fossil fuel sources emit carbon at varying degrees to
produce electricity. For example, both gas and coal emit more carbon
than renewable sources, but gas-burning power plants emit less carbon
than coal-burning power plants.</p>
<p>Carbon awareness is the idea of doing more when more energy comes
from low carbon sources and doing less when more energy comes from high
carbon sources.</p>

<h3 id="carbon-intensity">Carbon intensity<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#carbon-intensity"></a>
</h3>
<p>Carbon intensity measures how much carbon (CO2e) is emitted per
kilowatt-hour (KWh) of electricity consumed. The standard unit of carbon
intensity is gCO2eq/kWh, or grams of carbon per kilowatt hour.</p>
<p>If your computer is plugged directly into a wind farm, its
electricity would have a carbon intensity of 0 gCO2eq/kWh since a wind
farm emits no carbon to produce that electricity. However, most people
can’t plug directly into wind farms; instead, they plug into power grids
supplied with electricity from various sources.</p>
<p>Once on a grid, you can’t control which sources supply the
electricity you are using; you simply get a mix of everything. So, your
carbon intensity will be a mix of all the current power sources in a
grid, both the lower- and the higher-carbon sources.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="variability-of-carbon-intensity">Variability of carbon intensity<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#variability-of-carbon-intensity"></a>

<p>Carbon intensity varies by location since some regions have an energy

<figure><img src=".././fig/07_variability_CI.png" title="image_tooltip" alt="alt_text" class="figure mx-auto d-block"><div class="figcaption">alt_text</div>
</figure><p>Carbon intensity also changes over time due to the inherent
variability of renewable energy caused by the unpredictability of
weather conditions. For example, when it’s cloudy or the wind isn’t
blowing, carbon intensity increases since more of the electricity in
your mix comes from sources that emit carbon.</p>

<h3 id="dispatchability-curtailment">Dispatchability &amp; curtailment<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#dispatchability-curtailment"></a>
</h3>
<p>Electricity demand varies during the day, and supply always needs to
be able to meet that demand. A brownout (a dip in the voltage level of
the power line) occurs if a utility doesn’t produce enough electricity
to meet demand. Conversely, if a utility produces more electricity than
is required, then to stop infrastructure burning out, breakers trip and
we have blackouts.</p>
<p>There needs to be a balance between the demand and supply of
electricity at all times and the responsibility for this usually falls
to the utility provider.</p>
<p>In the case of fossil fuels such as coal, it is easier to control the
power produced for this supply; this is called
<strong>dispatchability</strong>. However, in the case of renewable
power sources such as wind farms, the power produced cannot easily be
controlled (we can’t control how much the wind blows). If the power
source produces more electricity than is needed, that electricity is
thrown away; this is called <strong>curtailment</strong>.</p>

<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="marginal-carbon-intensity">Marginal carbon intensity<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#marginal-carbon-intensity"></a>
</h3>
<p>If you suddenly need to access more power - for example, you need to
turn on a light - that energy comes from the marginal power plant. The
marginal power plant is dispatchable, which means marginal power plants
are often powered by fossil fuels.</p>
<p>Marginal carbon intensity is the carbon intensity of the power plant
that would have to be employed to meet any new demand.</p>
<p>Fossil-fueled power plants rarely scale down to 0. They have a
minimum functioning threshold, and some don’t scale; they are considered
a consistent, always-on baseload. Because of this, we sometimes have the
scenario where we curtail (throw away) renewable energy while still
consuming energy from fossil fuel power plants.</p>
<figure><img src=".././fig/09_marginal_CI.png" title="image_tooltip" alt="alt_text" class="figure mx-auto d-block"><div class="figcaption">alt_text</div>
</figure><p>In these situations, the marginal carbon intensity will be 0
gCO2eq/kWh since we know that any new demand will match the renewable
energy we are curtailing.</p>

<h3 id="energy-markets">Energy markets<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#energy-markets"></a>
</h3>
<p>The exact market model varies around the world but broadly follows
the same model.</p>
<p>When the demand for electricity goes down, utilities need to
<strong>reduce</strong> the supply to balance supply and demand. They
can do this in one of two ways:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong>Buy less energy from fossil fuel plants.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><img src=".././fig/10_marginal_CI.png" title="image_tooltip" alt="alt_text" class="figure"> Energy from fossil fuel plants is usually the most
expensive so this is the preferred method. This directly translates to
burning fewer fossil fuels.</p>
<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>
<strong>Buy less energy from renewable sources</strong>. Renewable
sources are the cheapest, so they prefer not to do this. If a renewable
source doesn’t manage to sell all of its electricity, it has to throw
the rest away.</li>
</ol>
<p>Reducing the amount of electricity consumed in your applications can
help decrease the energy’s carbon intensity seeing as the first thing to
be scaled back are fossil fuels.</p>
<p>When the demand for electricity goes up, utilities need to increase
the supply to balance supply and demand. They can do this in one of two
ways:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong>Buy more energy from renewable sources that are currently
being curtailed</strong></li>
</ol>
<figure><img src=".././fig/11_marginal_CI.png" title="image_tooltip" alt="alt_text" class="figure mx-auto d-block"><div class="figcaption">alt_text</div>
</figure><p>If you are curtailing, it means you have excess energy you could
dispatch. Renewable energy is already the cheapest, so curtailed
renewable energy will be the cheapest dispatchable energy source.
Renewable plants will then sell the energy they would have had to
curtail.</p>
<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>
<strong>Buy more energy from fossil fuel plants</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<figure><img src=".././fig/12_marginal_CI.png" title="image_tooltip" alt="alt_text" class="figure mx-auto d-block"><div class="figcaption">alt_text</div>
</figure><p>Fossil fuels are inherently dispatchable; they can quickly increase
energy production by burning more. However, coal costs money, so this is
the least preferred solution.</p>
<p>Energy markets are some of the most complex markets in the world so
the above explanation is a simplification. But what’s important to
understand is that our goal is to increase investment into lower carbon
energy sources, like renewables, and decrease investment into higher
carbon sources, like coal. The best way to ensure money flows in the
right direction is to make sure you use electricity with the least
carbon intensity.</p>

world, electricity grids are changing from primarily burning fossil
fuels to sourcing energy from lower carbon sources like wind and solar.
This is one of our best hopes for meeting our global reduction targets.
As green software practitioners, let’s see some of the ways we can help
accelerate that transition.</p>
<p>The primary driver for the transition is economic rather than any
sustainability target. Renewables are winning because they are cheaper
and getting even more affordable over time. So, to help accelerate the
transition, we need to make renewable plants more profitable and fossil
fuel plants less profitable. The best way to do that is to use more
electricity when it’s coming from lower-carbon sources like renewables
and less electricity when it’s coming from higher-carbon sources.</p>
<p>Carbon intensity is lower when more energy comes from lower-carbon
sources and higher when it comes from higher-carbon sources.</p>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="demand-shifting">Demand shifting<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#demand-shifting"></a>
</h3>
<p>Being carbon aware means responding to shifts in carbon intensity by
increasing or decreasing your demand. If your work allows you to be
flexible with when and where you run workloads, you can shift
accordingly - consuming electricity when the carbon intensity is lower
and pausing production when it is higher. For example, training a
Machine Learning model at a different time or region with much lower
carbon intensity.</p>
<p><a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6128960" class="external-link">Studies</a>
show these actions can result in 45% to 99% carbon reductions depending
on the number of renewables powering the grid.</p>
<p>Demand shifting can be further broken down into spatial and temporal
shifting.</p>
<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="spatial-shifting">Spatial shifting<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#spatial-shifting"></a>
</h4>
<p>Spatial shifting means moving your computation to another physical
location where the current carbon intensity is lower. It might be a
region that naturally has lower carbon sources of energy. For example,
moving to different hemispheres depending on the season for more
sunlight hours.</p>
<figure><img src=".././fig/14_spatial_shifting.png" title="image_tooltip" alt="alt_text" class="figure mx-auto d-block"><div class="figcaption">alt_text</div>
</figure>
</div>
<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="temporal-shifting">Temporal shifting<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#temporal-shifting"></a>
</h4>
<p>If you can’t shift your computation spatially to another region,
another option you have is to shift to another time. Perhaps later in
the day or night when it’s sunnier or windier and, therefore, the carbon
intensity is lower. This is called temporal demand shifting. We can
predict future carbon intensity reasonably well through advances in
weather forecasting.</p>
<figure><img src=".././fig/15_temporal_shifting.png" title="image_tooltip" alt="alt_text" class="figure mx-auto d-block"><div class="figcaption">alt_text</div>
</figure><p>Some of the biggest technology companies have recognised the
importance of carbon awareness and are using advanced modeling
techniques to implement demand shifting.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Google Carbon Aware Data Centers</strong> - Google launched
a project to <a href="https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/sustainability/carbon-aware-computing-location/" class="external-link">make
some of the cloud workloads carbon aware</a>. They created models to
predict tomorrow’s carbon intensity and workload. They then shaped
large-scale workloads so more would happen when and where the carbon
intensity is lowest, but in such a way that they could still handle the
expected load.</li>
<li>
<strong>Microsoft Carbon Aware Windows</strong> - <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/windows-11-is-getting-an-eco-friendly-update-but-could-microsoft-do-more" class="external-link">Microsoft
announced a project to make Windows 11 more sustainable</a>. Initially,
this means running Windows updates when the carbon intensity is
lower.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="demand-shaping">Demand shaping<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#demand-shaping"></a>
</h3>
<p>Demand shifting is the strategy of moving computation to regions or
times when the carbon intensity is lowest. Demand shaping is a similar
strategy. However, instead of moving demand to a different region or
time, we shape our computation to match the existing supply.</p>
<figure><img src=".././fig/16_demand_shaping.png" title="image_tooltip" alt="alt_text" class="figure mx-auto d-block"><div class="figcaption">alt_text</div>
</figure><ul>
<li>If carbon intensity is low, increase the demand; do more in your
applications.</li>
<li>If carbon intensity is high, decrease demand; do less in your
applications.</li>
</ul>
<p>Demand shaping for carbon-aware applications is all about the supply
of carbon. When the carbon cost of running your application becomes
high, shape the demand to match the supply of carbon. This can happen
automatically, or the user can make a choice.</p>
<p>Eco mode is an example of demand shaping. Eco modes are found in
everyday appliances like cars or washing machines. When activated, some
amount of performance is sacrificed in order to consume fewer resources
(gas or electricity). Because there is this trade-off with performance,
eco modes are always presented to a user as a choice.</p>
<p>Software applications can also have eco modes that can - either
automatically or with user consent - make decisions to reduce carbon
emissions.</p>
<p>One example of this is video conferencing software that adjusts
streaming quality automatically. Rather than streaming at the highest
quality possible at all times, it reduces the video quality to
prioritize audio when the bandwidth is low.</p>
<p>Another example is TCP/IP. The transfer speed increases in response
to how much data is broadcast over the wire.</p>
<p>A third example is progressive enhancement with the web. The web
experience improves depending on the resources and bandwidth available
on the end user’s device.</p>
<p>Demand shaping is related to a broader concept in sustainability,
which is to reduce consumption. We can achieve a lot by becoming more
efficient with resources, but we also need to consume less at some
point.</p>
<p>As Green Software practitioners, we would consider canceling a
process when the carbon intensity is high instead of demand shifting -
reducing the demands of our application and the expectations of our end
users.</p>

<p>The device you are using to read this on produced carbon when it was
manufactured and, once it reaches the end of life, disposing of it may
release more. Embodied carbon (also referred to as “embedded carbon”) is
the amount of carbon pollution emitted during the creation and disposal
of a device.</p>
<p>When calculating the total carbon pollution for computers running
software, both the carbon pollution associated with running the computer
as well as the embodied carbon of the computer must be accounted
for.</p>
<figure><img src=".././fig/17_embodioed_carbon.png" title="image_tooltip" alt="alt_text" class="figure mx-auto d-block"><div class="figcaption">alt_text</div>
</figure><p>Embodied carbon varies significantly between end-user devices. For
some devices, the carbon emitted during manufacturing is much higher
than that emitted during usage, as illustrated by a <a href="https://www.ifi.uzh.ch/dam/jcr:fa4e956e-7a53-4038-98a5-00e09e2f4303/Study_Digitalization_Climate_Protection_Summary_Oct2017.pdf" class="external-link">study</a>
from University of Zurich. As a result, the embodied carbon cost can
sometimes be much higher than the carbon cost of the electricity
powering it.</p>
<p>By thinking in terms of embodied carbon, any device, even one not

lifetime.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="amortization">Amortization<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#amortization"></a>

<p>A way to account for embodied carbon is to amortize the carbon over
the expected life span of a device. For example, suppose it took 4000kg
CO2eq to build a server, and we expect it to last four years.
Amortization means that we can say the server emits 1000kg
CO2eq/year.</p>

<hr class="half-width">
<p>If we take into account the embodied carbon, it is clear that by the
time we come to buy a computer, it’s already emitted a good deal of
carbon. Computers also have a limited lifespan, which means they
eventually are unable to handle modern workloads and need to be
replaced. In these terms, hardware is a proxy for carbon, and since our
goal is to be carbon efficient, we must also be hardware efficient.</p>
<p>There are two main approaches to hardware efficiency:</p>
<ul>
<li>For end-user devices, it’s <strong>extending the lifespan</strong>
of the hardware.</li>
<li>For cloud computing, it’s <strong>increasing the
utilization</strong> of the device.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="extending-the-lifespan-of-hardware">Extending the lifespan of hardware<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#extending-the-lifespan-of-hardware"></a>
</h3>
<p>In the example we saw previously, if we can add just one more year to
the lifespan of our server, then the amortized carbon drops from 1000kg
CO2eq/year to 800kg CO2eq/year.</p>
<figure><img src=".././fig/19_lifespan.png" title="image_tooltip" alt="alt_text" class="figure mx-auto d-block"><div class="figcaption">alt_text</div>
</figure><p>Hardware is retired when it breaks down or struggles to handle modern
workloads. Of course, hardware will always break down eventually but, as
developers, we can use software to build applications that run on older
hardware and extend their lifetime.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="increasing-device-utilization">Increasing device utilization<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#increasing-device-utilization"></a>
</h3>
<p>In the cloud space, hardware efficiency most often translates to an
increase in the utilization of servers. It’s better to use one server at
100% utilization than 5 servers at 20% utilization because of the cost
of embodied carbon. In the same way that owning one car and using it
every day of the week is much better than owning five and using a
different one each day of the week, it is much more efficient to use
servers at their full capacity rather than employing several at below
capacity. Although emissions are the same, the embodied carbon that is
used is much lower.</p>
<figure><img src=".././fig/20_increasing_utilization.png" title="image_tooltip" alt="alt_text" class="figure mx-auto d-block"><div class="figcaption">alt_text</div>
</figure><p>The most common reason for having under-utilized servers is so that
peak capacity is accounted for. Running servers at 20% means that you
know you will be able to handle peaks in demand without impacting
performance. However, in the meantime, all that spare capacity just
sitting there idle represents wasted embodied carbon. Being hardware
efficient means making sure that every hardware device is being utilized
as much as possible for as long as possible.</p>
<p>This is one of the main advantages of the public cloud; you know that
when you do need to scale up, the space will be there to take up the
slack. With multiple organizations making use of the public cloud, spare
capacity can always be made available to whoever needs it, so that no
servers are sitting idle.</p>
<p>It’s important to note that simply moving operations to the public
cloud will not automatically reduce your emissions. It simply gives you
the space to be able to re-architect your software so that a reduction
is possible.</p>

<p>The Greenhouse Gas (GHG) protocol is the most commonly-used method
for organizations to measure their total carbon emissions. Understanding
GHG scopes and how to measure your software against industry standards
will help you see to what extent you are applying Green Software
principles and how far you have to go to improve.</p>
<p>To complement the GHG protocol, you can also use the Software Carbon
Intensity (SCI) specification. While the GHG is a more generic
measurement suitable for all types of organizations, the SCI is
specifically for measuring a rate of software emissions and designed to
incentivize the elimination of those emissions.</p>
<p>The GHG is a protocol to measure total emissions, the SCI is a tool
to enable the elimination of software driven emissions.</p>
<p>We will look at each of the measurement methodologies and explain how
to calculate in either case.</p>
</section><section><h2 class="section-heading" id="the-ghg-protocol">The GHG protocol<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#the-ghg-protocol"></a>
</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>The <a href="https://ghgprotocol.org" class="external-link">Greenhouse Gas protocol</a> is
the most widely used and internationally recognized greenhouse gas
accounting standard. <a href="https://ghgprotocol.org/about-us" class="external-link">92%</a>
of Fortune 500 companies use the GHG protocol when calculating and
disclosing their carbon emissions.</p>
<p>The GHG protocol divides emissions into three scopes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Scope 1</strong>: Direct emissions from
<strong>operations</strong> owned or controlled by the reporting
organization, such as on-site fuel combustion or fleet vehicles.</li>
<li>
<strong>Scope 2</strong>: Indirect emissions related to
<strong>emission generation of purchased energy</strong>, such as heat
and electricity.</li>
<li>
<strong>Scope 3</strong>: Other indirect emissions from all the
other activities you are engaged in. Including all <strong>emissions
from an organization’s supply chain;</strong> business travel for
employees, and the electricity customers may consume when using your
product.</li>
</ul>
<p>Scope 3, sometimes referred to as value chain emissions, is the most
significant source of emissions and the most complex to calculate for
many organizations. These encompass the full range of activities needed
to create a product or service, from conception to distribution. In the
case of a laptop, for example, every raw material used in its production
emits carbon when being extracted and processed. Value chain emissions
also include emissions from the use of the laptop, meaning the emissions
from the energy used to power the laptop after it has been sold to a
customer.</p>
<p>Through this approach, it’s possible to sum up all the GHG emissions
from every organization and person in the world and reach a global
total.</p>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="what-scope-does-my-application-fall-into">What scope does my application fall into?<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#what-scope-does-my-application-fall-into"></a>
</h3>
<p>We have already seen how the GHG protocol asks us to bucket software
emissions according to scopes 1-3. But how does this work when it comes
to software?</p>
<p>Most organizations have many applications running with different
architectures and in different environments. As such, the scope your
emissions fall into, both in terms of energy generated as well as
embodied carbon, depending on your specific scenario.</p>
<figure><img src=".././fig/22_scope.png" title="image_tooltip" alt="alt_text" class="figure mx-auto d-block"><div class="figcaption">alt_text</div>
</figure><ul>
<li>
<strong>For cloud applications running on servers that you
own</strong>, the energy usage of your software falls into scope 2, and
the embodied carbon of all your servers falls into scope 3.</li>
<li>
<strong>For cloud applications running on a public cloud</strong>,
both the energy usage of your application and the embodied carbon fall
into scope 3.</li>
<li>In scenarios where <strong>you are running a hybrid private/public
cloud application</strong>, part of its emissions will fall into scope 2
and part will fall into scope 3.</li>
<li>Similarly, for your customer-facing <strong>front-end
application</strong>, energy usage falls into your organization’s scope
3, since your customer will purchase the energy to power their
device.</li>
</ul>
<p>For software, regardless of whether it’s run on infrastructure you
own, rent, or consumers own, there are three parameters to consider for
bucketing emissions:</p>
<ul>
<li>How much energy it consumes</li>
<li>How clean or dirty that electricity is</li>
<li>How much hardware it needs to function</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="is-it-possible-to-calculate-a-total-for-software-carbon-emissions">Is it possible to calculate a total for software carbon
emissions?<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#is-it-possible-to-calculate-a-total-for-software-carbon-emissions"></a>
</h3>
<p>To calculate a total for software carbon emissions, you need access
to detailed data regarding the energy consumption, carbon intensity, and
hardware that your software is running on. This is challenging data to
gather, even in the case of an organization’s own closed-source software
products where they can track its usage with telemetry or logs.</p>
<p>Open-source software maintainers don’t have the same visibility into
how and where their software is used, how much energy is consumed, and
on what hardware.</p>
<p>Open-source projects typically have multiple contributors from
multiple organizations. As a result, it’s unclear who should be
responsible for calculating the emissions as well as who is accountable
for eliminating them. When you also consider that open-source software
makes up 90% of a typical enterprise stack, it is clear that there is
going to be a large amount of carbon emissions that are not accounted
for.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="do-totals-tell-the-whole-story">Do totals tell the whole story?<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#do-totals-tell-the-whole-story"></a>
</h3>
<p>A total is only one metric that describes the state of something. To
make the right decisions, you need to look at many different
metrics.</p>
<p>Imagine a scenario where you are the leader of an organization and
charged with reducing the emissions of your software. You measure the
emissions in Q1 and come out with a total of 34 tonnes. After making
some investments into projects that eliminate emissions, you find that
by Q2 the emissions have increased to 45 tonnes. Does this mean your
efforts failed?</p>
<p>Not necessarily. We know that a total by itself doesn’t tell the
whole story and must look at other metrics to find out if an
emissions-reduction project has been successful. For example, if you
measured the carbon intensity as well as the carbon total, you might
come out with a different perspective. In the same project, if the
carbon intensity was 3.3g CO2eq/user in Q1, and 2.9g CO2eq/user in Q2,
you might consider the project a success and continue to invest
further.</p>
<p>While the total showed you that your organization’s carbon emissions
had increased overall, the intensity gave a more complete perspective
that would help you to make a more informed decision on how to
proceed.</p>
</div>
</section><section><h2 class="section-heading" id="software-carbon-intensity-specification">Software Carbon Intensity specification<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#software-carbon-intensity-specification"></a>
</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>The <a href="https://grnsft.org/sci" class="external-link">Software Carbon Intensity (SCI)
specification</a> is a methodology developed by the Standards Working
Group in the Green Software Foundation, designed to score a software
application along a dimension of sustainability and to encourage action
towards eliminating emissions.</p>
<p>It’s not a replacement for the GHG protocol, but an additional metric
that helps software teams understand how their software behaves in terms
of carbon emissions so they can make more informed decisions. While the
GHG protocol calculates the <strong>total emissions</strong>, the SCI is
about calculating the <strong>rate of emissions</strong>. In automotive
terms, the SCI is more like a miles per gallon measurement and the GHG
protocol is more like the total carbon footprint of a car manufacturer
and all their cars they produce every year.</p>
<p>Instead of bucketing the carbon emissions of software into scopes
1-3, it buckets them into <strong>operational emissions</strong> (carbon
emissions from the running of software) and <strong>embodied
emissions</strong> (carbon emissions from the physical resources
required to run the software). It’s also an intensity rather than a
total, which is more inclusive of open-source software.</p>
<p>An important thing to note is that it is not possible to reduce your
SCI score by purchasing offsets in the form of neutralizations,
compensations, or by offsetting electricity in the form of renewable
energy credits. This means that an organization that makes no efforts
towards reducing their emissions but simply spends money on carbon
credits cannot achieve a good SCI score.</p>
<p>Offsets are an essential component of any climate strategy; however,
offsets are not eliminations and therefore are not included in the SCI
metric.</p>
<p>If you make your application more <strong>energy efficient, hardware
efficient</strong>, or <strong>carbon aware</strong>, your SCI score
will decrease. The only way to reduce your SCI score is to invest time
or resources into one of those three principles. As such, adopting the
SCI as a metric for your software application along with the GHG
protocol, will drive investment into one of the three pillars of green
software.</p>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="the-sci-equation">The SCI equation<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#the-sci-equation"></a>
</h3>
<p>The SCI is a method of scoring any software application, not limited
to just cloud or not just end-user applications, but all types of
applications in between. It provides a common language to describe how
software behaves with respect to carbon emissions and how a proposed
change might eliminate some of them.</p>
<p>The equation to calculate an SCI score is elegantly simple. This
simplicity means it can be applied in a number of different
scenarios.</p>
<figure><img src=".././fig/23_SCI.png" title="image_tooltip" alt="alt_text" class="figure mx-auto d-block"><div class="figcaption">alt_text</div>
</figure><p><code>SCI = ((E *I) + M) per R</code></p>
<p><code>E</code> = Energy consumed by a software system <code>I</code>
= Location-based marginal carbon emissions<em> <code>M</code> = Embodied
emissions of a software system.</em> <code>R</code> = Functional unit
(e.g. carbon per additional user, API-call, ML job, etc)</p>
<p>This summarizes to:</p>
<p><code>SCI = C per R</code> (Carbon per <code>R</code>)</p>
<p><code>R</code> is the core characteristic of the SCI and turns it
into an intensity rather than a total. This is what we call a
<em>functional unit</em>.</p>
</div>
</section><section><h2 class="section-heading" id="how-to-calculate-your-sci-score">How to calculate your SCI score<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#how-to-calculate-your-sci-score"></a>
</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>Follow these four steps to calculate your SCI score.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Decide what to include</li>
</ol>
<p>What software components to include or exclude in the SCI score means
defining the boundaries of your software; where it starts and where it
ends.</p>
<p>For every software component you include, you will need to measure
its impact. For every major component you exclude, you need to explain
why.</p>
<p>The SCI specification doesn’t currently make any demands regarding
what to include and what not to include. However, you must include all
supporting infrastructure and systems that significantly contribute to
the software operation.</p>
<p>Your SCI score might decrease because you tightened your software
boundary and excluded more software components. Conversely, your SCI
score might increase because you are including software components you
previously excluded. Therefore, when you report your SCI score,
especially any improvements in the score, it’s essential to disclose
your software boundary.</p>
<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Choose your functional unit</li>
</ol>
<p>As we have seen, the SCI is a rate rather than a total and measures
the intensity of emissions according to the chosen functional unit. The
specification currently doesn’t prescribe the functional unit and you
are free to pick whichever best describes how your application scales.
For example, if your application scales by the number of users, then
pick users as your functional unit.</p>
<p>Future iterations of the SCI might prescribe specific functional
units for different types of applications to aid with comparability. For
instance, we might ask streaming applications to choose minutes as their
functional unit in order to standardize measurement across all streaming
applications.</p>
<ol start="3" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Decide how to measure your emissions</li>
</ol>
<p>Now you have a list of the software components you want to measure
and the functional unit you will use to measure them. The next step is
to decide how you will quantify the emissions of each software
component.</p>
<p>There are two methods of quantification; measurement and
calculation.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Measurement</strong> is using counters of some form. For
example, measuring the energy consumption of your software component by
using a hardware device in the wall socket. Or using counters on
hardware that directly measure energy consumption. If you can directly
count your units, you should use the measurement approach.</li>
<li>
<strong>Calculation</strong> involves indirect counting, often using
a model of some form. For instance, if you cannot directly measure your
application’s energy consumption but instead have a model that estimates
the energy consumption based on the CPU utilization, this is considered
calculation rather than measurement.</li>
</ul>
<p>These resources can help you to decide on measurement and calculation
methods:</p>
<ul>
<li>Look at the <a href="https://sci-guide.greensoftware.foundation/" class="external-link">Software Carbon
Intensity Guide</a> project. This project is responsible for providing
advice on how to quantify different software components’ emissions.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="4" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Quantify</li>
</ol>
<p>Now you are ready to execute. Using the methodology described in the
previous steps, start to quantify the SCI score for each software
component in your boundary. Your total SCI score of your software
application is the combined score of all the different components.</p>
<p>You may calculate multiple SCI scores for the same application. The
SCI score is helpful information to understand how your application
behaves with respect to carbon emissions in different scenarios. For
example, a streaming application might choose carbon per minute as a
metric. It might also calculate the carbon per user per day. The carbon
per $ revenue metric might give another helpful dimension.</p>

<p>In recent years, many economic actors have sought to reach different

“climate neutral” have been used interchangeably with the primary

<p>The <a href="https://sciencebasedtargets.org/" class="external-link">Science Based Targets
Initiative</a> refers to a mechanism called <a href="https://sciencebasedtargets.org/resources/legacy/2020/09/foundations-for-net-zero-executive-summary.pdf" class="external-link">abatement</a>,
which means eliminating sources of CO2 emissions associated with a
company’s operations and <a href="https://www.cisl.cam.ac.uk/education/graduate-study/pgcerts/value-chain-defs" class="external-link">value
chain</a> so that they do not enter the atmosphere. The value chain
describes the full range of activities needed to create a product or
service, from conception to distribution. This includes increasing
energy efficiency to eliminate some of the emissions associated with
energy generation.</p>
<p>Abatement is not enough on its own as there will always be some
emissions that can’t be eliminated due to technological or economic
constraints, but it must form the core of every organization’s strategy
as it is an area where almost every company can improve on.</p>
<p>To balance those residual emissions, we need to look at other
mechanisms such as offsets, compensations or neutralizations.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="offsets">Offsets<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#offsets"></a>
</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.offsetguide.org/understanding-carbon-offsets/what-is-a-carbon-offset/" class="external-link">Offsets</a>
are direct investments in emission-reduction projects through the
purchase of carbon credits on the voluntary carbon market (VCM). The VCM
is a decentralized market where private actors voluntarily buy and sell
carbon credits that represent certified removals or reductions of GHGs
from the atmosphere.</p>
<p>To offset emissions, you need to purchase the equivalent volume of
carbon credits to compensate for those emitted, where 1 carbon credit
corresponds to 1 tonne of CO2 absorbed or reduced.</p>
<p>Various positive benefits can stem from these projects, from
ecosystem protection to empowering local communities. However, to ensure
these programs are implemented correctly and have the desired effect on
the environment and the aim to reach world net zero, there are global
standards that they must meet such as Verified Carbon Standard (VCS) and
Gold Standard (GS).</p>
<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="sci-and-offsets">SCI and Offsets<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#sci-and-offsets"></a>
</h4>
<p>There are some limitations to carbon offsets and that is why they are
not considered in an organization’s SCI score. For example, imagine two
applications, both running on a cloud platform that is 100% carbon
offset and matched 100% by renewable energy. Application A has invested
significant time and resources into making sure it is using resources
efficiently, whereas application B uses resources very inefficiently.
For the SCI to be a helpful metric, application A needs to score better
than application B.</p>
<p>If the SCI considered offsets, both applications would score 0. This
wouldn’t tell us anything about how efficiently they are using
resources. Although application B is emitting more carbon molecules into
the atmosphere, since its score is 0 and the lowest score is 0, why
would it make further investments into improving its carbon
efficiency?</p>
<p>Organizations need to have plans for how to both eliminate as well as
neutralize emissions and the SCI helps them to drive the elimination of
emissions due to software. This makes the SCI an essential component of
any net-zero strategy.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.abatable.com/blog/carbon-removal-vs-carbon-avoidance-projects" class="external-link">Compensations</a>

emissions outside of their value chain. This is essentially investing in
other organizations’ abatement projects.</p>

</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.abatable.com/blog/carbon-removal-vs-carbon-avoidance-projects" class="external-link">Neutralizations</a>
are actions that companies take to remove carbon from the atmosphere
within or beyond their value chain. Neutralizations refer to the removal
and permanent storage of atmospheric carbon to counterbalance the effect
of releasing CO2 into the atmosphere. This includes actions such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Enhancing natural carbon sinks</strong> that remove CO2 from
the atmosphere. For example, forest restoration, since photosynthesis
removes CO2 naturally. Forest expansion comes with challenges as it’s
essential not to impact the dynamics of farmland and food supply
elsewhere. Modern farming methods can also prolong the time carbon
remains stored in soil.</li>
<li>
<strong>Direct air capture</strong> is the process of capturing CO2
from the air and storing it permanently, either underground or in
long-lived products like concrete.</li>
</ul>
<p>The effectiveness of these methods is typically measured based on
whether they can deliver carbon removal at the scale and speed
needed.</p>
<p>When it comes to carbon removal projects, durability is a critical
consideration. The durability of a project describes how long the carbon
dioxide will be kept from the atmosphere.</p>
<p>Short-term durability is up to 100 years, medium-term is 100 to 1,000
years, and long-term is more than 1,000 years.</p>
<ul>
<li>Solutions that rely on Earth’s natural carbon cycle have short-term
durability measured in decades. For example, forestry projects have a
durability of 40 to 100 years.</li>
<li>Engineered solutions such as direct air capture often have long-term
durability measured in millennia. For example, direct air capture has a
durability of 10,000 years.</li>
<li>Long-term projects are typically orders of magnitude more expensive
than short-term projects. Once emitted, carbon remains in the atmosphere
for 5,000 years. To be considered net zero, carbon that has been emitted
needs to be permanently removed.</li>
</ul>
<p>A short-term carbon removal project will only remove carbon for 100
years, after which it’s back in the atmosphere warming up our planet.
This is one of the reasons why abatement is preferred to neutralization.
Never releasing carbon is far better than releasing carbon and then
trying to keep it out of the atmosphere for 5,000 years.</p>

<hr class="half-width">
<p>There are many different climate reduction strategies that an
organization can commit to, from carbon neutral to net zero.
Understanding the different meanings and implications of each one can
help you decide on the right strategy for your organization.</p>
<figure><img src=".././fig/25_climate_commitments.png" title="image_tooltip" alt="alt_text" class="figure mx-auto d-block"><div class="figcaption">alt_text</div>
</figure><div class="section level3">
<h3 id="carbon-neutral">Carbon Neutral<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#carbon-neutral"></a>
</h3>
<p>To achieve carbon neutrality, an organization must measure its
emissions, then match the total to its emissions offsets through carbon
reduction projects. This can include carbon removal projects
(neutralizations) and carbon avoidance projects (compensations).</p>
<p>Carbon neutrality is defined by an internationally recognized
standard: <a href="https://info.eco-act.com/hubfs/0%20-%20Downloads/PAS%202060/PAS%202060%20factsheet%20EN.pdf" class="external-link">PAS
2060</a>. Although this does recommend an organization sets abatement
targets, it doesn’t demand they reduce their emissions. So to be
considered carbon neutral, an organization can just measure and offset
without investing resources in eliminating their carbon emissions.</p>
<p>To be carbon neutral, you must cover direct emissions (scope 1 and
2). The general expectation is that organizations measure and offset
their scopes 1 and 2, and business travel from scope 3. However, there
is no specific requirement to include that.</p>
<p>Carbon neutral is a significant first step for any organization since
it encourages measurement. However, there are not enough carbon offsets
in the world to offset the emissions of all the organizations.
Therefore, any strategy that doesn’t include abatement will not scale or
help the world achieve the 1.5 degree target set by the Paris Climate
Agreement. This is where net zero comes into play.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="net-zero">Net Zero<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#net-zero"></a>
</h3>
<p>Net zero means reducing emissions according to the latest climate
science and balancing remaining residual emissions through carbon
removals (neutralizations). Net zero, by definition, requires emissions
reductions in line with a 1.5°C pathway. All businesses must do this to
achieve net-zero global emissions by 2050.</p>
<p>The critical differentiator between net zero and carbon neutral is
net zero’s focus on abatement rather than neutralizations and
compensations. A net-zero target aims to eliminate emissions and only to
use offsetting for the residual emissions that you cannot eliminate</p>
<p>The <a href="https://sciencebasedtargets.org/resources/files/foundations-for-net-zero-full-paper.pdf" class="external-link">standard
for net zero</a> is being developed by the <a href="https://sciencebasedtargets.org/" class="external-link">Science Based Targets
initiative</a> (SBTi). They calculate that there is a 66% probability of
limiting global warming to 1.5°C if we reach a level of abatement of
about 90% of all GHG emissions by mid-century. So, to meet a net-zero
target, an organization needs to eliminate 90% of its emissions by 2050.
The remaining emissions can only be offset using neutralizations and
permanent carbon removals.</p>
<p>A net-zero strategy would mean that the actual amount of carbon in
the atmosphere remains constant.</p>
<p>Also, to be a net-zero target, you must cover direct and indirect,
i.e. supply chain emissions (scopes 1,2 and 3). Therefore, your entire
value chain needs to be included in the scope of your net-zero target.
This is significant since scope 3 often represents the majority of
emissions.</p>
<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="sci-as-part-of-a-net-zero-strategy">SCI as part of a Net-Zero strategy<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#sci-as-part-of-a-net-zero-strategy"></a>
</h4>
<p>The SCI is a metric specifically designed to drive the elimination of
emissions. The only way to reduce your score is to invest time and
resources into actions that eliminate emissions. The only activities the
SCI recognizes as elimination actions are making your application more
energy-efficient, more hardware efficient, or consuming lower-carbon
energy sources. Offsets are an essential component of any climate
strategy; however, offsets are not eliminations and therefore are not
included in the SCI metric.</p>
<p>Any net-zero strategy needs to have plans for how to both eliminate
as well as neutralize emissions. The SCI helps organizations drive the
elimination of emissions due to software. This makes the SCI an
essential component of any net-zero strategy.</p>

<h3 id="renewable">100% Renewable<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#renewable"></a>
</h3>
<p>When organizations set a target of 100% renewable power, they might
distinguish between being <strong>matched by</strong>
vs. <strong>powered by</strong> renewables.</p>
<p><strong>Powered by</strong> means you are directly powered by a
renewable power source, say a hydro dam. In that scenario, the energy
the device receives only originates from that source, so you can
confidently say that you are 100% powered by renewables.</p>
<figure><img src=".././fig/26-27_100_renewable.png" title="image_tooltip" alt="alt_text" class="figure mx-auto d-block"><div class="figcaption">alt_text</div>
</figure><p>For most people, we live on an interconnected grid, with many
producers pumping electricity in and many consumers taking electricity
out. This means the electrons coming into your device are a mixture of
all the electrons going into the grid. For example, suppose the grid
only has 5% of wind supply. You are getting 5% of wind-generated
electrons and 95% fossil fuel-generated electrons.</p>
<p>You can’t track individual electrons. Once the electrons from a wind
farm are on a grid, they all mix with the electrons from a fossil fuel
plant. So there is no way for a consumer to insist the electrons that it
uses only come from renewable sources.</p>
<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="renewable-energy-certificates-rec">Renewable Energy Certificates (REC)<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#renewable-energy-certificates-rec"></a>
</h4>
<p>To solve this problem, a renewable plant sells two things. The first
is its electricity, which it sells into a grid. The second is a REC, a
<a href="https://www.epa.gov/green-power-markets/renewable-energy-certificates-recs" class="external-link">Renewable
Energy Certificates</a>. 1 REC equals 1kWh of energy.</p>
<p>If you want to be 100% matched by renewable energy and are on the
grid, the solution is to buy enough RECs to cover the amount of
electricity you consume. For instance, if you consume 100 kWh of
electricity every day, then to be 100% matched by renewables, you buy
100 RECs.</p>
<p>When organizations set 100% renewable targets purchasing RECs on the
market is the solution they often employ to meet their commitments.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="ppas">PPAs<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#ppas"></a>
</h4>
<p>You might also hear the term PPA used alongside RECs. A PPA is a <a href="https://ppp.worldbank.org/public-private-partnership/sector/energy/energy-power-agreements/power-purchase-agreements" class="external-link">Power
Purchase Agreement</a>, which is another way to purchase RECs. If you
estimate you need 500MWh of electricity per year for a particular data
center, you might sign a PPA to purchase 500MWh per year from a
renewable plant. You would then get all the RECs associated with this
power plant.</p>
<p>PPAs are typically very long-term contracts. A renewable plant can
find financing with one of these agreements since it already has had a
buyer for its electricity for many years.</p>
<p>PPAs encourage something called <strong>additionality</strong>.
Purchasing a PPA drives the creation of new renewable plants. PPAs are a
solution that gets us towards a future where everyone has access to 100%
renewable energy.</p>

<h3 id="hourly-matching">24/7 Hourly Matching<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#hourly-matching"></a>
</h3>
<p>When it comes to 100% renewable claims, the critical question is,
what is the granularity of matching? Do you sum up and net off yearly,
monthly, weekly, daily, or hourly? That question is essential because to
truly transition to renewable energy, we need 100% of the power to come
from low-carbon energy sources like renewables 100% of the time. This
fine granular matching is often called <em><a href="https://www.epa.gov/green-power-markets/247-hourly-matching-electricity" class="external-link">24/7
hourly matching</a></em>.</p>
<p>24/7 hourly matching is one of the many strategies we need to employ
to help accelerate the transition to a 100% renewable-powered grid. For
example, <a href="https://sustainability.google/progress/energy/" class="external-link">Google</a> and <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2021/07/14/made-to-measure-sustainability-commitment-progress-and-updates/" class="external-link">Microsoft</a>
have both committed to 24/7 hourly matching by 2030.</p>
<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="daily-vs-hourly-matching">Daily vs hourly matching<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#daily-vs-hourly-matching"></a>
</h4>
<figure><img src=".././fig/28_daily_vs_hourly.png" title="image_tooltip" alt="alt_text" class="figure mx-auto d-block"><div class="figcaption">alt_text</div>
</figure><p>Imagine an organization has a demand curve like this, each blue
square represents 1kWh:</p>
<figure><img src=".././fig/29_daily_consumption.png" title="image_tooltip" alt="alt_text" class="figure mx-auto d-block"><div class="figcaption">alt_text</div>
</figure><p>They have purchased RECs from a wind farm that generated electricity
with a curve, so each green square represents 1 REC. Matching by day
means the organization consumed 18 kWh and bought 18 RECs. As a result,
they netted off to zero. So they can say they are <strong>100% matched
by renewable energy daily.</strong></p>
<p>However, if we looked at it in hourly buckets (each square here is 2
hrs in length), then it seems a bit different:</p>
<figure><img src=".././fig/30_hourly_match.png" title="image_tooltip" alt="alt_text" class="figure mx-auto d-block"><div class="figcaption">alt_text</div>
</figure><p>The total amount of energy consumed is still 18kWh. However, there
are only a few hours in the day where we are 100% matched by renewable
energy for that hour. So for some hours, we have way more renewable
energy than we need. Conversely, we have way less renewable energy than
we require for most hours.</p>
<p>In the above example, they are <strong>100% matched by renewable
energy on an hourly basis for only 6 hrs of the day</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="carbon-free-energy">Carbon-free energy<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#carbon-free-energy"></a>
</h4>
<p>The number we use to describe how successful we are at 24/7 hourly
matching is the carbon-free energy percentage.</p>
<p>Carbon-free energy is defined as <a href="https://cloud.google.com/sustainability/region-carbon#understanding" class="external-link">the
average percentage of carbon-free energy consumed in a particular
location on an hourly basis</a>.</p>
<p>So for the previous example, if measured using daily matching, we are
100% matched with renewable energy. However, we are only 33.1% matched
if measured using hourly matching. <strong>The CFE percentage is,
therefore, 33.1%</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="carbon-awareness-as-part-of-a-247-hourly-matching-strategy">Carbon Awareness as part of a 24/7 Hourly Matching Strategy<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#carbon-awareness-as-part-of-a-247-hourly-matching-strategy"></a>
</h4>
<p>Carbon aware computing involves responding to electrical carbon
intensity signals and changing the <strong>behavior</strong> of
software, so it emits less carbon. Carbon awareness also helps an
organization meet their 24/7 hourly matching target and increase its CFE
percentage.</p>
<p>One example of a behavior change is shifting compute to a time when
more renewable energy is available. For example, delaying the start of a
training run of a machine learning model, or even delaying charging of a
laptop, to when the carbon intensity of electricity is lower, and the
supply of renewable energy is higher.</p>

<ul>
<li>There are a number of methodologies commonly applied to help in the
overall fight against climate change. These fall into the general
categories of carbon elimination (also known as ‘abatement’), carbon
avoidance (a.k.a. ‘compensating’), or carbon removal (a.k.a.
‘neutralizing’).</li>
<li>Abatement includes increasing energy efficiency to eliminate some of
the emissions associated with energy generation. Abatement is the most
effective way to fight climate change although complete carbon
elimination is not possible.</li>
<li>Compensating includes the adoption of renewable energy sources,
sustainable living practices, recycling, planting trees etc.</li>
<li>Neutralizations refer to the removal and permanent storage of
atmospheric carbon to counterbalance the effect of releasing CO2 into
the atmosphere. Neutralizations tend to remove the carbon from the
atmosphere in the short and medium-term.</li>
<li>An organization can call itself Carbon Neutral when its total
emissions are matched by the total of its emissions offsets through
carbon reduction projects</li>
<li>Net zero aims to eliminate emissions and only offset the residual
emissions that you cannot eliminate to reach the 1.5°C target set by the
Paris Climate Agreement.</li>
<li>The SCI is carefully designed so that eliminating emissions, through
energy efficiency, hardware efficiency and carbon awareness is the only
way to reduce the score. Together with a separate neutralization
strategy, it can form the basis of a net-zero strategy for an
organization.</li>
<li>When organizations set a target of 100% renewable power, they can
either be “matched by” vs. “powered by” renewables, where “powered by”
means the energy the device receives only originates from renewable
sources. This can be achieved by purchasing RECs as part of a PPA.</li>
<li>24/7 hourly matching is one of the many strategies we need to employ
to help accelerate the transition to a 100% renewable-powered grid.</li>
