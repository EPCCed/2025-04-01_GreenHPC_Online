<p>Green software is an emerging discipline at the intersection of
climate science, software design, electricity markets, hardware, and
data center design.</p>
<p>Green software is carbon-efficient software, meaning it emits the
least carbon possible. Only three activities reduce the carbon emissions
of software; energy efficiency, carbon awareness, and hardware
efficiency. This training will explain all of these concepts, how to
apply them to your processes and how to measure them, as well as some of
the international guidelines and organizations that guide and monitor
this space.</p>

<p><a href="https://climate.nasa.gov/global-warming-vs-climate-change/" class="external-link">Global
warming</a> is the long-term heating of Earth’s climate system observed
since the pre-industrial period (between 1850 and 1900) due to human
activities, primarily fossil fuel burning. <a href="https://climate.nasa.gov/global-warming-vs-climate-change/" class="external-link">Climate
change</a> is long-term shifts in temperatures and weather patterns.
These shifts may be natural, but since the 1800s, human activities have
been the main driver of climate change.</p>

<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="climate-vs-weather">Climate vs weather<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#climate-vs-weather"></a>
</h3>
<p>Weather refers to the conditions of the atmosphere in a short period
of time. Climate refers to the conditions of the atmosphere over long
periods of time. Any changes to the long-term condition of the
atmosphere will also cause changes to the short-term conditions. An
obvious comparison is that if the average temperature of the atmosphere
increases, the average temperature of the weather in any given season
will also increase. Some examples of measurable changes to weather
conditions due to climate change are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Changes to the water cycle, including rainfall</li>
<li>Melting of ice</li>
<li>Heating of the land, air, and ocean</li>
<li>Changes in ocean currents, acidity, and salinity</li>
</ul>
<p>These changes can lead to flooding - both in coastal areas and due to
increased rainfall - drought, wildfires and more frequent extreme
weather conditions.</p>

<h3 id="greenhouse-gases-and-the-greenhouse-effect">Greenhouse gases and the greenhouse effect<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#greenhouse-gases-and-the-greenhouse-effect"></a>
</h3>
<p>Greenhouse gases are a group of gases that trap heat from solar
radiation in the Earth’s atmosphere. These gases act as a blanket,
increasing the temperature on the surface of the Earth. This is a
natural phenomenon which has been accelerated due to man-made carbon
emissions. Now the global climate is changing at a faster rate than that
at which animals and plants can adapt.</p>
<p>Greenhouse gases and the greenhouse effect are crucial to all life on
Earth and often come from natural sources like animals, volcanoes, and
other geological activity. The greenhouse effect allows the Earth to
maintain a higher temperature than it would without them by capturing
more heat from solar radiation. Like many other natural processes of the
Earth, the greenhouse effect is a finely tuned balance that can be upset
by multiple factors.</p>

<h3 id="carbon-and-co2eq">Carbon and CO2eq<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#carbon-and-co2eq"></a>

<p>Carbon is often used as a broad term to refer to the impact of all
types of emissions and activities on global warming. CO2eq/CO2-eq/ CO2e,
which stands for carbon equivalence, is a measurement term used to
measure this impact. For example, 1 ton of methane has the same warming
effect as about <a href="https://energy.ec.europa.eu/topics/oil-gas-and-coal/methane-emissions_en" class="external-link">84
tons of CO2 over 20 years</a>, so we normalize it to 84 tons CO2eq. We
may shorten even further to just carbon, which is a term often used to
refer to all GHGs.</p>

<p>Energy is the ability to do work. There are many different forms of
energy, such as heat, electrical and chemical, and one type of energy
can be converted to another. For example, we convert chemical energy
from coal to electrical energy. In other words, electricity is secondary
energy converted from another energy type. In this way, we can think of
energy as a measure of the electricity used.</p>
<p>All software, from the applications running on mobile phones to the
training of Machine Learning models running in data centers, consumes
electricity. One of the best ways to reduce electricity consumption and
the subsequent carbon emissions made by software is to make applications
more energy efficient. However, that’s not where our responsibility
ends.</p>
<p>Green software practitioners take responsibility for the energy
consumed by their products and design them to consume as little as
possible. We should make sure that, at every step in the process, there
is as little waste as possible and that most of the energy goes to the
next step.</p>
<p>The final step in this chain is represented by the end user of your
product, not the finished product itself. This means our goal is not
simply to make the most energy efficient code or the “greenest”
software, but to think about the end user and how to make sure they are
not creating unnecessary emissions.</p>
<p>This might mean batching jobs together to take advantage of energy
proportionality or changing how a user uses your software. Let’s take a
look at some of these concepts and some ways that you can become more
energy efficient at every stage of the chain, right up to the final
consumer.</p>

<p>Most electricity is produced through burning fossil fuels, <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/world-electricity-by-source" class="external-link">usually
coal</a>. Fossil fuels are made from decomposing plants and animals.
These fuels are found in the Earth’s crust and contain carbon and
hydrogen, which can be burned for energy. Coal, oil, and natural gas are
examples of fossil fuels.</p>

when we plug something into a wall, and our laptops don’t need exhaust
pipes. However, since most electricity comes from burning fossil fuels
and energy supply is the <a href="https://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/daviz/change-of-co2-eq-emissions-2#tab-chart_4" class="external-link">single

line from electricity to carbon emissions. In these terms, electricity
can be considered a proxy for carbon.</p>
<p>If our goal is to be carbon efficient, then it means our goal is also
to be energy efficient since energy is a proxy for carbon. This means
using the least amount of energy possible per unit of work.</p>

<p>The data center industry uses the <a href="https://datacenters.lbl.gov/sites/default/files/WP49-PUE%20A%20Comprehensive%20Examination%20of%20the%20Metric_v6.pdf" class="external-link">power
usage effectiveness</a> (PUE) metric, developed by Green Grid in 2006,
to <strong>measure data center energy efficiency</strong>. Specifically,
this relates to how much energy the computing equipment uses as compared
to cooling and other overheads supporting the equipment. When a data
center’s PUE is close to 1.0, computing is using nearly all energy. When
the PUE is 2.0, this means an additional watt of IT power is required to
cool and distribute power to the IT equipment for every watt of IT power
it uses.</p>
<p>Another way to think of PUE is as a multiplier to your application’s
energy consumption. So, for example, if your application consumed 10 kWh
and the PUE of the data center where it is running is 1.5, then the
actual consumption from the grid is 15 kWh: 5kWh goes towards the
operational overhead of the data center, and 10 kWh goes to the servers
that are running your application.</p>

<h3 id="energy-proportionality">Energy proportionality<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#energy-proportionality"></a>
</h3>
<p><a href="https://research.google/pubs/pub33387/" class="external-link">Energy
proportionality</a>, first proposed in 2007 by engineers at Google,
measures <strong>the relationship between power consumed by a computer
and the rate at which useful work is done</strong> (its
utilization).</p>
<p>Utilization measures how much of a computer’s resources are used,
usually given as a percentage. A fully utilized computer running at its
maximum capacity has a high percentage, while an idle computer with no
utilization has a lower percentage.</p>
<p>The relationship between power and utilization is not proportional.
Mathematically speaking, proportionality between two variables means
their ratios are equivalent. For example, at 0% utilization, a computer
can draw 100W; at 50%, it draws 180W; and at 100%, it draws 200W. The
relationship between power consumption and utilization is not linear and
does not cross the origin.</p>
<figure><img src=".././fig/06_energy_proportionality_updated.png" title="image_tooltip" alt="alt_text" class="figure mx-auto d-block"><div class="figcaption">alt_text</div>
</figure><p>Because of this, the more we utilize a computer, the more efficient
it becomes at converting electricity to practical computing operations.
One way to improve hardware efficiency is to run the workload on as few
servers as possible, with the servers running at the highest utilization
rate, maximizing energy efficiency.</p>
<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="static-power-draw">Static power draw<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#static-power-draw"></a>
</h4>
<p>The static power draw of a computer is <strong>how much electricity
is drawn when in an idle state</strong>. The static power draw varies by
configuration and hardware components, but all parts have some static
power draw. This is one of the reasons that PCs, laptops, and end-user
devices have power-saving modes. If the device is idle, it will
eventually trigger a hibernation mode and put the disk and screen to
sleep or even change the CPU’s frequency. These power-saving modes save
on electricity, but they have other trade-offs, such as a slower restart
when the device wakes up.</p>
<p>Servers are usually not configured for aggressive or even minimal
power saving. Many use cases running on servers demand total capacity as
quickly as possible because the server needs to respond to rapidly
changing demands, which leads to many servers in idle modes during
low-demand periods. An idle server has a carbon cost from both the
embedded carbon as well as its inefficient utilization.</p>

<ul>
<li>Electricity is a proxy for carbon, so building an application that
is energy efficient is equivalent to building an application that is
carbon efficient.</li>
<li>Green software takes responsibility for its electricity consumption
and is designed to consume as little as possible.</li>
<li>Quantifying the energy consumption of an application is a step in
the right direction to start thinking about how an application can
operate more efficiently. However, understanding your application’s
energy consumption is not the only story. The hardware your software is
running on uses some of the electricity for operational overhead. This
is called power usage efficiency (PUE) in the cloud space.</li>
<li>The concept of energy proportionality adds another layer of
complexity since hardware becomes more efficient at turning electricity
into useful operations the more it’s used.</li>

<p>Not all electricity is produced in the same way. In different
locations and times, electricity is generated using a variety of sources
with varying carbon emissions. Some sources, such as wind, solar, or
hydroelectric, are clean, renewable sources that emit little carbon. On
the other hand, fossil fuel sources emit carbon at varying degrees to
produce electricity. For example, both gas and coal emit more carbon
than renewable sources, but gas-burning power plants emit less carbon
than coal-burning power plants.</p>
<p>Carbon awareness is the idea of doing more when more energy comes
from low carbon sources and doing less when more energy comes from high
carbon sources.</p>

<h3 id="carbon-intensity">Carbon intensity<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#carbon-intensity"></a>
</h3>
<p>Carbon intensity measures how much carbon (CO2e) is emitted per
kilowatt-hour (KWh) of electricity consumed. The standard unit of carbon
intensity is gCO2eq/kWh, or grams of carbon per kilowatt hour.</p>
<p>If your computer is plugged directly into a wind farm, its
electricity would have a carbon intensity of 0 gCO2eq/kWh since a wind
farm emits no carbon to produce that electricity. However, most people
can’t plug directly into wind farms; instead, they plug into power grids
supplied with electricity from various sources.</p>
<p>Once on a grid, you can’t control which sources supply the
electricity you are using; you simply get a mix of everything. So, your
carbon intensity will be a mix of all the current power sources in a
grid, both the lower- and the higher-carbon sources.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="variability-of-carbon-intensity">Variability of carbon intensity<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#variability-of-carbon-intensity"></a>
</h3>
<p>Carbon intensity varies by location since some regions have an energy
mix containing more clean energy sources than others.</p>
<figure><img src=".././images/07_variability_CI.png" title="image_tooltip" alt="alt_text" class="figure mx-auto d-block"><div class="figcaption">alt_text</div>
</figure><p>Carbon intensity also changes over time due to the inherent
variability of renewable energy caused by the unpredictability of
weather conditions. For example, when it’s cloudy or the wind isn’t
blowing, carbon intensity increases since more of the electricity in
your mix comes from sources that emit carbon.</p>

<h3 id="dispatchability-curtailment">Dispatchability &amp; curtailment<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#dispatchability-curtailment"></a>
</h3>
<p>Electricity demand varies during the day, and supply always needs to
be able to meet that demand. A brownout (a dip in the voltage level of
the power line) occurs if a utility doesn’t produce enough electricity
to meet demand. Conversely, if a utility produces more electricity than
is required, then to stop infrastructure burning out, breakers trip and
we have blackouts.</p>
<p>There needs to be a balance between the demand and supply of
electricity at all times and the responsibility for this usually falls
to the utility provider.</p>
<p>In the case of fossil fuels such as coal, it is easier to control the
power produced for this supply; this is called
<strong>dispatchability</strong>. However, in the case of renewable
power sources such as wind farms, the power produced cannot easily be
controlled (we can’t control how much the wind blows). If the power
source produces more electricity than is needed, that electricity is
thrown away; this is called <strong>curtailment</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="marginal-carbon-intensity">Marginal carbon intensity<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#marginal-carbon-intensity"></a>
</h3>
<p>If you suddenly need to access more power - for example, you need to
turn on a light - that energy comes from the marginal power plant. The
marginal power plant is dispatchable, which means marginal power plants
are often powered by fossil fuels.</p>
<p>Marginal carbon intensity is the carbon intensity of the power plant
that would have to be employed to meet any new demand.</p>
<p>Fossil-fueled power plants rarely scale down to 0. They have a
minimum functioning threshold, and some don’t scale; they are considered
a consistent, always-on baseload. Because of this, we sometimes have the
scenario where we curtail (throw away) renewable energy while still
consuming energy from fossil fuel power plants.</p>
<figure><img src=".././images/09_marginal_CI.png" title="image_tooltip" alt="alt_text" class="figure mx-auto d-block"><div class="figcaption">alt_text</div>
</figure><p>In these situations, the marginal carbon intensity will be 0
gCO2eq/kWh since we know that any new demand will match the renewable
energy we are curtailing.</p>

<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="energy-markets">Energy markets<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#energy-markets"></a>
</h3>
<p>The exact market model varies around the world but broadly follows
the same model.</p>
<p>When the demand for electricity goes down, utilities need to
<strong>reduce</strong> the supply to balance supply and demand. They
can do this in one of two ways:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong>Buy less energy from fossil fuel plants.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><img src=".././images/10_marginal_CI.png" title="image_tooltip" alt="alt_text" class="figure"> Energy from fossil fuel plants is usually the most
expensive so this is the preferred method. This directly translates to
burning fewer fossil fuels.</p>
<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>
<strong>Buy less energy from renewable sources</strong>. Renewable
sources are the cheapest, so they prefer not to do this. If a renewable
source doesn’t manage to sell all of its electricity, it has to throw
the rest away.</li>
</ol>
<p>Reducing the amount of electricity consumed in your applications can
help decrease the energy’s carbon intensity seeing as the first thing to
be scaled back are fossil fuels.</p>
<p>When the demand for electricity goes up, utilities need to increase
the supply to balance supply and demand. They can do this in one of two
ways:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong>Buy more energy from renewable sources that are currently
being curtailed</strong></li>
</ol>
<figure><img src=".././images/11_marginal_CI.png" title="image_tooltip" alt="alt_text" class="figure mx-auto d-block"><div class="figcaption">alt_text</div>
</figure><p>If you are curtailing, it means you have excess energy you could
dispatch. Renewable energy is already the cheapest, so curtailed
renewable energy will be the cheapest dispatchable energy source.
Renewable plants will then sell the energy they would have had to
curtail.</p>
<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>
<strong>Buy more energy from fossil fuel plants</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<figure><img src=".././images/12_marginal_CI.png" title="image_tooltip" alt="alt_text" class="figure mx-auto d-block"><div class="figcaption">alt_text</div>
</figure><p>Fossil fuels are inherently dispatchable; they can quickly increase
energy production by burning more. However, coal costs money, so this is
the least preferred solution.</p>
<p>Energy markets are some of the most complex markets in the world so
the above explanation is a simplification. But what’s important to
understand is that our goal is to increase investment into lower carbon
energy sources, like renewables, and decrease investment into higher
carbon sources, like coal. The best way to ensure money flows in the
right direction is to make sure you use electricity with the least
carbon intensity.</p>

<p>Using electricity when the carbon intensity is low is the best way to

<figure><img src=".././images/13_carbon_aware.png" title="image_tooltip" alt="alt_text" class="figure mx-auto d-block"><div class="figcaption">alt_text</div>
</figure><p>There is a global transformation happening right now. All around the
world, electricity grids are changing from primarily burning fossil
fuels to sourcing energy from lower carbon sources like wind and solar.
This is one of our best hopes for meeting our global reduction targets.
As green software practitioners, let’s see some of the ways we can help
accelerate that transition.</p>
<p>The primary driver for the transition is economic rather than any
sustainability target. Renewables are winning because they are cheaper
and getting even more affordable over time. So, to help accelerate the
transition, we need to make renewable plants more profitable and fossil
fuel plants less profitable. The best way to do that is to use more
electricity when it’s coming from lower-carbon sources like renewables
and less electricity when it’s coming from higher-carbon sources.</p>
<p>Carbon intensity is lower when more energy comes from lower-carbon
sources and higher when it comes from higher-carbon sources.</p>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="demand-shifting">Demand shifting<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#demand-shifting"></a>
</h3>
<p>Being carbon aware means responding to shifts in carbon intensity by
increasing or decreasing your demand. If your work allows you to be
flexible with when and where you run workloads, you can shift
accordingly - consuming electricity when the carbon intensity is lower
and pausing production when it is higher. For example, training a
Machine Learning model at a different time or region with much lower
carbon intensity.</p>
<p><a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6128960" class="external-link">Studies</a>
show these actions can result in 45% to 99% carbon reductions depending
on the number of renewables powering the grid.</p>
<p>Demand shifting can be further broken down into spatial and temporal
shifting.</p>
<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="spatial-shifting">Spatial shifting<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#spatial-shifting"></a>
</h4>
<p>Spatial shifting means moving your computation to another physical
location where the current carbon intensity is lower. It might be a
region that naturally has lower carbon sources of energy. For example,
moving to different hemispheres depending on the season for more
sunlight hours.</p>
<figure><img src=".././images/14_spatial_shifting.png" title="image_tooltip" alt="alt_text" class="figure mx-auto d-block"><div class="figcaption">alt_text</div>
</figure>
</div>
<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="temporal-shifting">Temporal shifting<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#temporal-shifting"></a>
</h4>
<p>If you can’t shift your computation spatially to another region,
another option you have is to shift to another time. Perhaps later in
the day or night when it’s sunnier or windier and, therefore, the carbon
intensity is lower. This is called temporal demand shifting. We can
predict future carbon intensity reasonably well through advances in
weather forecasting.</p>
<figure><img src=".././images/15_temporal_shifting.png" title="image_tooltip" alt="alt_text" class="figure mx-auto d-block"><div class="figcaption">alt_text</div>
</figure><p>Some of the biggest technology companies have recognised the
importance of carbon awareness and are using advanced modeling
techniques to implement demand shifting.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Google Carbon Aware Data Centers</strong> - Google launched
a project to <a href="https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/sustainability/carbon-aware-computing-location/" class="external-link">make
some of the cloud workloads carbon aware</a>. They created models to
predict tomorrow’s carbon intensity and workload. They then shaped
large-scale workloads so more would happen when and where the carbon
intensity is lowest, but in such a way that they could still handle the
expected load.</li>
<li>
<strong>Microsoft Carbon Aware Windows</strong> - <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/windows-11-is-getting-an-eco-friendly-update-but-could-microsoft-do-more" class="external-link">Microsoft
announced a project to make Windows 11 more sustainable</a>. Initially,
this means running Windows updates when the carbon intensity is
lower.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="demand-shaping">Demand shaping<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#demand-shaping"></a>
</h3>
<p>Demand shifting is the strategy of moving computation to regions or
times when the carbon intensity is lowest. Demand shaping is a similar
strategy. However, instead of moving demand to a different region or
time, we shape our computation to match the existing supply.</p>
<figure><img src=".././images/16_demand_shaping.png" title="image_tooltip" alt="alt_text" class="figure mx-auto d-block"><div class="figcaption">alt_text</div>
</figure><ul>
<li>If carbon intensity is low, increase the demand; do more in your
applications.</li>
<li>If carbon intensity is high, decrease demand; do less in your
applications.</li>
</ul>
<p>Demand shaping for carbon-aware applications is all about the supply
of carbon. When the carbon cost of running your application becomes
high, shape the demand to match the supply of carbon. This can happen
automatically, or the user can make a choice.</p>
<p>Eco mode is an example of demand shaping. Eco modes are found in
everyday appliances like cars or washing machines. When activated, some
amount of performance is sacrificed in order to consume fewer resources
(gas or electricity). Because there is this trade-off with performance,
eco modes are always presented to a user as a choice.</p>
<p>Software applications can also have eco modes that can - either
automatically or with user consent - make decisions to reduce carbon
emissions.</p>
<p>One example of this is video conferencing software that adjusts
streaming quality automatically. Rather than streaming at the highest
quality possible at all times, it reduces the video quality to
prioritize audio when the bandwidth is low.</p>
<p>Another example is TCP/IP. The transfer speed increases in response
to how much data is broadcast over the wire.</p>
<p>A third example is progressive enhancement with the web. The web
experience improves depending on the resources and bandwidth available
on the end user’s device.</p>
<p>Demand shaping is related to a broader concept in sustainability,
which is to reduce consumption. We can achieve a lot by becoming more
efficient with resources, but we also need to consume less at some
point.</p>
<p>As Green Software practitioners, we would consider canceling a
process when the carbon intensity is high instead of demand shifting -
reducing the demands of our application and the expectations of our end
users.</p>
