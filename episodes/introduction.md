## What is green software use?

Green software use is an emerging discipline at the intersection of climate science, software design, electricity markets, hardware, and data center design.

Green software use is carbon-efficient software use, meaning it emits the least carbon possible. Only three activities reduce the carbon emissions of software; energy efficiency, carbon awareness, and hardware efficiency. This workshop will explain all of these concepts, how to apply them to use cases on high-performance computing (HPC) systems and how to measure them, as well as some of the international guidelines and organisations that guide and monitor this space.

## Who is this aimed at?

Anyone involved in using HPC resources - either as a user, a developer of software for use on HPC or even professionals. By studying these principles, you will be able to better understand the effect of their use of HPC on carbon emissions, where it fits with emissions from your other activities and what concrete actions you can take to reduce your emissions and the size of the impact from these reductions.

## History

In 2019 the original eight principles of green software engineering were released. This 2022 update of the principles took on feedback received over the years, merging some principles and adding a new one regarding understanding climate commitments.

## How to understand green software on HPC

The following training covers 6 key areas of green software on HPC:

1. **Carbon Efficiency**: Emit the least amount of carbon possible.
2. **Energy Efficiency**: Use the least amount of energy possible.
3. **Carbon Awareness**: Do more when the electricity is cleaner and do less when the electricity is dirtier.
4. **Hardware Efficiency**: Use the least amount of embodied carbon possible.
5. **Measurement**: What you can't measure, you can't improve.
6. **Climate Commitments**: Understand the exact mechanism of carbon reduction.

Each of these episodes will introduce some new concepts and explain in detail why they are important in terms of the climate, and how you can apply them in your work on HPC systems. We will use the [ARCHER2 UK National Supercomputing Serivce](https://www.archer2.ac.uk) to provide concrete examples of how the principles can be applied.

## Principles, Patterns, and Practices.

This workshop's key areas and content describe the **principles** of green software, a core set of competencies needed to define, build and run green software.

A green software [**pattern**](https://patterns.greensoftware.foundation/) is a specific example of how to apply one or more principles in a real-world example. Whereas principles describe the theory that underpins green software, patterns are the practical advice software practitioners can use in their software applications today. Patterns are vendor-neutral.

A green software **practice** is a pattern applied to a specific vendor's product and informs practitioners about how to use that product in a more sustainable way. 

Practices should refer to patterns that should refer to principles.

The green software foundation publishes a [catalog of vendor-neutral green software patterns](https://patterns.greensoftware.foundation/) across various categories.
