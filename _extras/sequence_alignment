layout: episode
teaching: 20
exercises: 0
questions:
- "How can I align sequences without complex installation?"
- "How can I use a container from within and without?"
- "How can I share/use existing sequence files residing on my computer?"
objectives:
- "Select Docker containers from the docker hub."
- "Use a Docker container to accomplish tasks."

> ## EMBOSS 
> “The European Molecular Biology Open Software Suite” ([EMBOSS](http://emboss.sourceforge.net/) is a free Open Source software analysis package specially developed for the needs of the molecular biology user community. 
> EMBOSS contains a large number of sequence analysis tools, and we’ll sample a few of them via a docker method. 

The purpose of this tutorial is more about learning how to use a Docker container rather than learning EMBOSS itself. 
To learn more about EMBOSS: List of applications: [emboss_apps](http://emboss.sourceforge.net/apps/release/6.6/emboss/apps/index.html) 
grouped by [function](http://emboss.sourceforge.net/apps/release/6.6/emboss/apps/groups.html), and [emboss tutorials](http://emboss.sourceforge.net/docs/emboss_tutorial/emboss_tutorial.html)

> ## Set-up
> Macintosh: Double click on `Terminal` icon in the `/Applications/Utilities directory`. 
> Windows: Open `PowerShell`
> Linux: open a new shell terminal

In your terminal shell window login Docker with your credentials. 
If you need to create an ID now go to the [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com) to register a free account.

~~~
$ docker login
~~~
{: .language-bash}
~~~
Login with your Docker ID to push and pull images from Docker Hub. 
If you don't have a Docker ID, head over to https://hub.docker.com 
to create one.
Username: YOUR_DOCKER_ID_HERE

We'll use an existing container for EMBOSS version 6.6.0. The following `pull` command will make a copy of the docker image on your local computer.
Note that the lengthy tag `v6.6.0dfsg-7b1-deb_cv1` is necessary since it is not the `latest` tag.

~~~
$ docker pull biocontainers/emboss:v6.6.0dfsg-7b1-deb_cv1
~~~
{: .language-bash}
~~~
v6.6.0dfsg-7b1-deb_cv1: Pulling from biocontainers/emboss
478cd0aa93c0: Pull complete 
[...]
$ 
~~~
{: .output}

You can verify that the image now exists on your system:

~~~
$ docker image ls biocontainers/emboss
~~~
{: .language-bash}
~~~
