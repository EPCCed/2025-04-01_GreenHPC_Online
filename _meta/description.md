This workshop aims to introduce the use of Docker containers (and similar technology). Containers
can help to make your work more reproducible. Your work becomes instantly accessible to potential
users without going through pages of install instructions or days of compiling decade-old Fortran
programs. Your work can continue to be accessible in the coming years.

Containers allow a researcher to package up a project with all of the parts it needs - such as
libraries, dependencies, and system settings - and ship it all out as one package. Anyone can then
open up a container and work within it, viewing and interacting with the project as if the machine
they are accessing it from is identical to the machine specified in the container - regardless of
what their computational environment actually is. They are designed to make it easier to transfer
projects between very different environments.

The workshop will introduce the basics of running software with Docker and teach you 
how you can use containers to make your research software more reusable and reproducible.
